Branching :

a->b*->c->d->
e->f->
merge : a->b->c->d->merge_confilt 

master branch 
temp brach - test then add to master branch 

//master
git checkout master

// new branch
git checkout -b  "branch-name"

// check brach
git branch

// delete the branch 
git branch -D branch-name
* when you change back to master , changes on other branch is not seen in brach.

// merge 
git merge branch-name

// merge confit when master also have commited & merge it at in mid of master so merge confict occur
    When code are different thus merge confilt occur so resolve it mannually.
    you can combine also choose one also.....

** const age = 20 ; | const age = 90 -> no error : cause value get upadated , by Git !
    but if const age = 20 | cahnged in master const age = 22 |  const age = 30 -> then it shows merge confilt 


## other method : rebase : linear graph
   *rebasing
    master : a->b->c* ->d->e 
    other : s->d 
    rebase : a->b->c->d->e->s'->d' 
        s & d are depended on e so s & d will have changes s' & d'
        e quality will merge.

//rebase : should be other branch
git rebase master
git add .
git rebase --continue // not commit !! // all changes will be done in other banch not master
git merge master // go to master branch then 

// INSERT : i for insetion 
:wq // esc + save & quit
