HTML : hyper text markup language

1.Heading :Use heading tag h1,h2,h3,h4,h5,h6 in order thats a good habit.
  search engine checks heading for better search.  
2.Paragraph 2 types : <p></p> && <pre>as written in .html</pre>
3.lorem : Unnessary words created to check how it looks on webpage.
4. <hr> : create a lines horizontal , as to separate parts in webpage.
5. <br> : next line 

6. List : 
6.1 <ul> </ul> - unordered List
    Attribute <ul style=""> : 
       *style="list-style-type: ;" {none,circle,square,disc}
6.2 <ol> </ol> - order List - Follow order 
    Attribute <ol type="" start=""> : 
       *type=" " {a,A,i,I} //alphabet count, Roman count
       *start="10" //starts count from 10
6.3 <li> </li> - List Item - common for both to mention items.
 
7. Ancore Tag - travel through web-pages, display is inline by default.
<a href="link.com"> visible_name </a> 
    property <a href="" target="">:
       *target="_blank" //To launch link in new webpage, default self.

8. Image : self-closing tag
<img src=""> 
    Attribute <img src="" height="" width="" alt="">:
       *height=""
       *width=""
       *alt="" //If image don't render display a text which is in alt=""
   * Absolute path 
   Complete Address : Works for everyone : 
   photo can be anywhere in computer its address starts from root directary.
   Absolute path/Address : photo->get_info->properties->location
    But It won't work from our pc Cause other can access internal-drive-access but we can use from web!! 
   * Relative path
   Current place to final destination with in main file only.
   src="./" & src="../"
   Sing le dot means: look here, in the current folder
   Double dots mean: go back, one level up to the parent folder

9. Boiler Plate :
    
    computer only understand numbers/binary so all data are converted to binary.
    UTF-8 ? directary.
    All data of our site is converted  into binary.
    We know ASCII have 256 char only but world there are many languages and there char.
    So we use UTF-8, where binary is converted to UTF-8.
    UTF-8 isn't fixed size but varies. For example :
    English -> 1Byte/8Bits represented
    Latin -> 2Bytes represented
    Hindi, chines -> 3Bytes represented
    emoji -> 4Bytes represented

    How do we decide to read file, Cause file is in binary ? could be 1,2,3,4 bytes represented.
    READ 1Byte/8-bit if first bit is 0 then its english. If not 1 then
    First 3bit 110 -> read 2Bytes/16Bits at once.
    First 4bit 1110 -> read 3Bytes at once.
    First 5bit 11110 -> read 4Bytes at once.

    How IMAGE is stored ? How will it converted to binary ?
    Image is nothing but rows*columns of pixel.
    Every pixel store color information thus forming a image.
    Using RGB we can make any color. 
    24Bit 8 bits for Red + 8 bits for Green + 8 bits for Blue = 24 bits total per pixel.
    Color combinations: 2⁸ × 2⁸ × 2⁸ = 16,777,216 colors.
    48Bit give more clear images. Color combinations: 2¹⁶ × 2¹⁶ × 2¹⁶ = 281 trillion colors.
