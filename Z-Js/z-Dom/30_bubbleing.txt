* if child is clicked and parent will also get event listen if it has.
    first child event exectued, then parent then its parent...
    * change ordering first parent exectued then child.
        c.addEventListener('click', ()=>{ // all 3 will be 
            console.log("c is clicked");
        },true) // by default its false so we don't write normally.
    * what does this true or false means
        it means capture phase is on or off.

*Tree is traverse from top window>document>html- capture phase, target phase, bubbling phase.
capture phase = false // reach child/target then goes back to parent
    *false is the bubbling phase.!!
    1.It first goes where actual action is done - from top of tree.
    2.then perform the addEventListener function 
    3.then it goes back through Tree and keeps checking if and addEventListener is applied or not if yes then apply it.
capture phase = true // keep checking parent untill it reach child/target
    1.It first check from top if event listen is added or not 
    2.if added then perform the addEventListener function 
    3.It goes on untill it find the target or actual action element & perform addEventListener function.
  
* event object :
c.addEventListener('click', (e)=>{ 
    console.log(e); // event object detail explanation about the event. eg cooridinate, type of event
    ** e.stopPropagation(); // no bubbling!!
})
    * e can tell exactly which element you have clicked.points which element caused the event.
        console.log(e.target); // Gives which element have triggered the event.
    * meaning no need to put event listener to all just on parent.
        e.target we can understand which child caused the event to occure.
        * make changes in that targeted element only.
        e.target.textContent = "";
        e.target.style. = "";
        console.log(e.type); gives wgich type of event
        e.id; //gives id of that event
