1. sizeof variable 
    gives what is the datatype of that variable

2. newvariable = DATATYPE(VARIABLE)
    This do not mutate the original variable.
    Functions like String(), Number(), and Boolean() convert a value to another datatype.
    The conversion result is returned, but the original variable does not change unless you assign it.
    If you don’t assign the result to a variable, the converted value is only used temporarily in that place.

    NaN typeof is Number.

    * String to NUmber :
    Not all string character can be number, like a,b,c,@,$....
    Error: 0/0 or If you try to convert character to Number then it shows NaN!!Not a Number
    * Number to string :
    All number can be string ! Never error.
    * Boolean to Number :
    true = 1 & false = 0
    * null to NUmber :
    answer : 0
    * undefiened to Number :
    answer : NaN
    * Number,string,null,undefiened to Boolean :
    all non-zero are true , 0 is converted to false. No initialization is also false(undefiened).
    "any string" -> true & "" -> false. Thus empty string is 0 in number.
    null and undefiened -> false.
    * Boolean to string :
    true -> "true" , false -> "false"
    * null,undefiened to string :
    null -> "null" & undefiened -> "undefiened"

Operation :
1.Arthematic : +,-,/,*,**,%
2.comparision : ==,===,>,<,>=,<=, !=
    * when >,<,<=,>= : number is the priority if different datatype is compared.
    auto conversion null convert to number 0.
    auto conversion undefiened to number NaN. null>=undefiened : false! can't be compared.
    * when you compare string & number, Js will convert string to number then compare.
        "" -> 0, empty string is 0.
    * two string compared :1st char is compared based on ASCII value return true / false.
    * Number & boolean compared : boolean converted to 0 or 1 .
    * NaN==NaN : false.
3.logical : &&, ||
    * boolean we know!
    * other datatype are Tried to convert to boolean then compare.
    * "string1"&&"string2" -> string2, && check if first value is true then it check second if true returns 2nd value.
     ""&&"string2" -> "" , first value is false so it don't check next condition. output empty string.
     "string1"&&"" -> "" , first value true checks next condition which is false so return "".
     10||20 -> 10, first value true so return first value.
     0 ||10 -> 10, first value false return 2nd value by default.
&, | : binary works!!

// Js problem !
let i = 0.1;
let i1 = 0.2;
let i2 = i+i1;
console.log(i2);// 0.300000000000004?
cause 0.1 or 0.2 isn't able to convert to binary exacctly so approx value is calculated.
consider 0.1 as string -> "0.1" + "0.2" -> convert 1 & 2 number and add.

* typeof null -> object.
* null is loosely equal to undefiened. null==undefiened true. null===undefiened false. Rest it's not equal to any!
