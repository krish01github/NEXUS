* We know server returns html,css,js. So server can understand Js.

* Why Js was created?
    -cause other language were hard. So devloper wanted a better programming language.
    -Security Nightmare, when c++ is runed c++ can access you system cause its a low level language.

* In Js if it wants to access anything of user it will ask permission first.

* Interpreter : line by line code is run.

* Complier that runs Js , 
* Chrome : v8 Engine.
* In firefox : spiderMoonkey complier.

* v8 Engine : To un Js!
    Code written C++ machine code . Who takes input as JS and generate output.
    So we also need c++ compiler so where is c++ compiler and how does it runs.
    Our System (os) can understand our machine code so our browser v8 Engine is in machine code.

* C++ is machine dependent. 
    Every os will convert machine code according to its system, same machinecode won't work on other os system.


* NodeJS- to run js on our vscode : has v8 Engine which is our C++ machine code
    It is our Runtime enviroment.


* node -v : gives version
* node main.js : to run the js code
