day27 : map method 

** .map() is a JavaScript array method used to:
Iterate over each element in an array
Transform (modify) each element according to a callback function
Return a new array containing the results of those transformations
It always returns a new array of the same length as the original.

** const arr = [9,39,4,53,2,54];
console.log(arr.map((num)=>num*2));// value is directly returned
console.log(arr.map((num)=>num>24));// num>24=true or false thus true/false will be returned.

** array having object in each index , we can't distrub size of array but can make changes in object.
let ans = arrayName.map((arrayName)=>({key1:arrayName.key1, key2:arrayName.key2}));

** reducer :- Iterate over array and give 1 value 
    *accumulater = initalial sum = 0, value returned in callback that goes to accumulater.
        ✅ At the first call,
        JavaScript sets
        accumulator = initialValue → here it’s 0.
    *current_value - current index value of array traversal.
    *syntax :- 
        let x = product.reduce((accumulater,currentPrice,index,arr)=>{
            return accumulater+currentPrice.price;// currentPrice is object so choice sub choice by .key
        },initalial_value_of_accumulater) // generally 0 so ot is number , else as string addition/concatination
