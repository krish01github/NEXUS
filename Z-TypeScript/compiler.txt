* compiler c/cpp - 1st convert file to machine code (compile time) -> we run that machine code (run time )-> cpu  
    java - convert to byte code :: error is caught during compile time !
* interpreter - no complie option -> execute the code line by line. That's why interpreter lang is slow.
* just in time ! JS!

* Just in time -> combination of compile + interpreter.
    Cpp is faster cause it has less steps.
    Js is a Just-In-Time language.

Error:
*run time error.

* first Js was slow. untill was updated js.
* first Js get interpreter run also it get converted into machine code and when code is run again then machine code is sent next time.
    machine code is sent 2nd time to cpu, CPU knows how to run machine code.

* Platform dependent(C/C++) - Platform(window,mac,linux)
    machine code c,cpp if run in mac works but on windows that machine code won't work.
    you need original code!
* Platform independent(Js,java) - java is converted to byte code & you need JVM 
    machine code is same for all Platform. so with just machine code we can run it.
    js need only browser to run!

* typescript is never run cause browser run only js.
    ts is to convert to js , Called transpliser - convert one language to other.
