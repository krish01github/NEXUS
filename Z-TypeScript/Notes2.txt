syntax :
* let variable_name:datatype = ;

* let x = ; // x datatype is with what it's initialized

** any_unknown.ts
*1 let variable_name; 
  let variable_name:any;
    datatype -> any , you can put any datatype ! behave just like Js variable!
*2 let variable_name:unknown; // same like any ! but safe cause you can't perform operation on unknown directly!
    If you want to operation on unknown variable  then we have to first check condition on variable then operate.


** non-primitive datatype!
*1 array -> *let/const variable_name:datatype[] = [];// datatype :: string,number
    if let a = [1,2,3] // compiler says its type  number 
    if let a = [1,"string",90] // string|number compiler says:: | is uninun
    *syntax for 2 datatype of an array :: let variable_name:(number|string)[] = [];
        other than that datatype it shows error!

*2 tuple - fixed number of elements , its similar to array 
    We already know in which order the data will come & there datatype!
    * let/const variable_name:[string,number] = ["hello",34];
    1st string 2nd number & if more than the specified gives error

*3 object - *4, *5
    let obj = {
        name: ""; //name:string ,if not mention transpliser will auto understand
    }
    * let obj:{name:string,age:number}{
        name:"keirh",
        age:34
    }

*4 type 
    Alises - we pre-define a object with setOf key-and its datatype then create a object & add its property
    type variable_name = {
        name:string,
        age:number,
        id:string
    }
    let newvar:variable_name = {
        name:"",
        age:,
        id:""
    }

*5 interface - best way to holding object datatype , cause it helps to merge muultiple interface.
    muultiple time we can declare interface with same name meaning same interface & it get merge.
    interface variable_name{
        name:string,
        age:number, // can use , ; or just go newline
        pos:string
    };
    interface variable_name{
        ip:string
    };// allwoed
    let newvar: variable_name = {
        name:"",
        age:,
        id:""
    };

* someTimes we don't want to use those specific key-pair or it may be optional in that case use 
    interface n{
        name?:string,
        age:number
    }
    const a:n = {
        age:23 // name is optional , thus no error !!!
    }
