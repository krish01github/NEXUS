Inline CSS

*Inline styles (e.g., <div style="color:red">) have the highest priority among normal declarations.

*Specificity (selector weight)
The more specific the selector, the higher its priority:
ID selectors (#id) > Class, attribute, pseudo-class selectors (.class, [attr], :hover) > Element/tag selectors (div, p).

*If two rules have the same specificity, the one that appears last in the CSS

*!important
Giving it the highest priority

!important > inline CSS > ID > class/attribute/pseudo-class > tag/element > ordering (last rule wins)
