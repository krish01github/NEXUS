syntax :-
@media screen {}

*screen, all content we want is to be shown on screen only.
*print, no one uses but it was used when we wanted to print web on paper.

*and 
    used to add another condition.

*(max-width:600px){} , when it hit 600px or below.
*(min-width:600px){} , when it hit 600px or above, kam-se-kam

css rule applys, (remember cascading)first default then check condition of @media.

*desktop-based : max-width
    default-desktop > tablet > mobile.
*phone-based : min-width [most used approach - load less cause only default will run]
