* inline & internal & external(can be used for multiple html page)
class : used for grouping multiple tags with same className.
id : for uniqely selecting.
, : using common we can group based selection.

* COLOR : 
1) rgb(red0to255_,green0to255_,blue0to255_, alpha/transpareny_50% is normal) : 3byte 8*8*8 bits.
2) #r_g_b_ : hexdecimal(0 to f).  same,3bytes/24bits.
3) hsl(0, 100%_intensity , 50%, 0to1_transparency): A fully saturated, normal lightness red.

* font-size :  
- px (Pixels): An absolute, fixed-size unit. font-size: 16px; means the text will be exactly 16 pixels tall. Good for consistency, but less flexible for users who want to change 
    their browser's default font size.
- em: A relative unit. 1em is equal to the font size of the **parent element**. If a parent <div> has a font-size of 16px, then font-size: 2em; on a child <p> will make it 32px (16 * 2).
- rem (Root Em): **The modern standard.** This is the most flexible and recommended unit. 1rem is equal to the font size of the **root <html> element**. This allows you to set a base 
    font size on the <html> tag, and then all your other font sizes can be relative to that one single value, making it incredibly easy to scale your entire site's typography.
- vw & vh : my visible width&height, n% of width screen.
- % : my direct parent elements n-% size.
*In CSS, whenever you use a percentage value for margin or padding (whether it’s top, bottom, left, or right), the reference is always the parent’s width, never its height.

* FONT :
font family :- use google font
generic familes-> serif, sans-serif, monospace, cursive, fantasy.
font-weight : 100 to 900;
font-style : italic;

* INLINE :
occupy only requiered space.
Won't allow height&width.
Horizontal (left & right) → works as expected, pushing content left/right.
Vertical (top & bottom) → visually applies, but does not push other elements away.

* BLOCK :
always starts from new line, take up entire width space.
Allows hight&width&padding&margin.

*DISPLAY: INLINE-BLOCK ;
It will act like inline but allows changes in hight,width,margin,padding like block.

*DISPLAY :
To convert block to inline :- display : inline;
