*Used in automating Layout! , 1Dimensional Layout only.

*parent/container & child relation is important for flexbox.

*display:flex;
    will make its child element tobe inline element.
    But it will cover entire height of parent container untill height of child is mentioned.

    But parent will remain block only.
    default direction of flex is row.
*flex-direction: ;
    column,row-reverse,column-reverse.

*flex-direction dicide the main axis & other as cross axis.

*justify-content: ; main axis changes only!!
*align-items: ; cross axis changes only!!
    when flex-direction is row : horizontal/main & verticcal/cross.
    when flex-direction is column : vertical/main & horizontal/main.
    center, space-around(margin introduced eg: 10px div 10px 10px div).
    start, end, space-between(first & last goes to start & end, mid equal space ).
    space-evenly(equal distance between any two div).

*resposive :
    *flex-wrap:no-wrap; , default
    *flex-wrap:wrap; , when content is compressed it goes to next line.
    *flex-wrap:wrap-reverse; , last divs remain in first line starting divs goes to new line.

*gap :
    In parent :- gap: px; (Horizontal)will be given in between childs. No need to separtly give margin to childs.

** Along the main axis, margins do affect spacing.
Example: in a row layout, margin-left / margin-right push flex items apart.
Along the cross axis, things are trickier:
Flex items are aligned by align-items or align-self.
Vertical margins (margin-top, margin-bottom) don’t push siblings apart like in block layout.
**child css property :

*flex-grow: int_val ; , default 0
    Controls how extra space is distributed.
    If extra space exist it will be occpied by the child div according to int_val.

*flex-shrink:int_val; , default 1
    decrese the div with int_val times compare to normal div with default 1.
    CSS property flex-shrink: 1 is default.
    This means: when children overflow the parent, the browser proportionally reduces their size so they fit inside.


*flex-basis : px; , changes of main axis so it depends on flex-direction.
    main axis will change even if u have already given main-width/heigh.
    priority will be given to flex-basis

*align-self: ;   , apply on cross axis.
    to algin particular div separtly from all others.
