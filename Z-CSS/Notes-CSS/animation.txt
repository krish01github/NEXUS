animation-name : Animationname ;
    Give name for the specific animation
animation-time : times[in s,ms..];
    Time taken to run the complete animation
animation-iteration-count: number[1,2,3..infinite];0%
    Number of times animation repeats.

    to control speed distribution of animation-duration.
    cubic-bezier( , , , )
animation-direction: ;
    To show which direction animation should occure,

animation-delay: times;
