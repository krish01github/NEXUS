** transition : 

.classname{
    /* when hover then changes occure immidiately but with adding transition we can decide how&when changes will hapen*/
    transition-property: ;
        write on which prperty the changes showuld occur.
    transition-duration: ;
        total time taken for the transition.
    transition-timing-function: ;
        to control speed distribution of transition-duration.
    transition-delay:;
        Time delay before changes starts.
    transition: property duration timing-function delay;
}

.classname:hover{
    ...All changes
}



** Difference between transition & animation :
    animation automatically works, but transition needs to be triggered.

** Transform : 
    It helps to not distribution aligment of other neighbor divs.
    Changes can only been to applied div.

*Transform  CAN BE WRITTEN DIRECTLY IN 
.classname{}

.classname:hover{
    transform : ;
        ** 2D 
        * scale(x) , allow to to grow x times the actual div.
            scaleY() , scaleX()
        * translate(x-axis , y-axis) , move the div in x & y axis.
            if used % then the div's hight&width n% is the movement.
        * rotate(30deg) , rotate 30 degree 2D way direction 
            
        * skew( deg) , used to tilt the div at 90deg won't be visible 90+ but less than 180 it shows inverted.
            skewX() , skewY()
        

        ** 3D 
        * translateZ() , movement is in z-direction which is 3D. But noting will visible on translate-z.
            In parent css use , perspective : px; then we can see z-direction Changes, coming towards us / growing .
        * rotateX() , in x-direction/backwards.
        * rotateY() , in y-direction/right turn.

}

* perspective : px; 
    from how far we are seeing thats number px.
    Me and screen distance is px.
