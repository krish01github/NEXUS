*flexbox only for 1D but grid is for arrangement in 2D layer.

*Grid is basically 2D Matrix.

*display: grid; , in parent div.

*grid-template-rows: px px ..; , no of px decides number of rows the parent will have
*grid-template-columns: px px ..;  , no of px decides number of columns the parent will have

*gap : ; 
    in parent style to give margin between each child.
    *row-gap: ; & columns-gap: ; 
    to give margin for row & columns separtly.

*Problem : child div may overflow :
    *making use of fraction (fr). So, now it won't come out of parent div. also number difines what is the fraction/size of each div.
    grid-template-rows: 1fr 1fr;
    grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;
    *Attribute : if there are multiple also x is the fraction of each div takes : repeat(number_of_times_fr  ,  x_fr)

*Like in table rowspan & colspan : grid-column-start, grid-column-end, grid-row-end, grid-row-start.
    /* 4-1 = 3rows is occupied, row merge */
    .box6{
     grid-column-start: 1;
     grid-column-end: 4;
    }
    /* sidebar/column merge */
    /* 4-2 = 2col is occupied */
    .box2{
        grid-row-start: 2;
        grid-row-end: 4;
    }

    *SHORT CUT :
    grid-column: x/y;
    grid-row: x/y;
    * To keep at exact position make use of both grid-c & grid-r .
