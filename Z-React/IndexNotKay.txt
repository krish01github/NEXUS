Index is never passed as key for array!
When array is made use while creating component then all array elements have same function being used.
If u want to only use that function only for a specific element then we need use of key! 
Key is unique for all elements.

** Key can't be passed as props !
** useState is attached with key!!
** state variable will holds it value during re-render !!

Ts      | Js       | Java
key=0   |key=1     | key =2
count=4 |count=8   | count=9

--re-render // count is a state variable || useState
* useState & key are attached/linked so for a key value will be same !

C++     | Ts       | Js        | java
** arr index is always same || So, when key created it check if that key l=already exist if so give same details 
key=0   |key=1     | key =2    | key=3 
count=4 |count=8   | count=9   | count=0// This was created new

** Even when you sort the array with key=index then you get wrong value cause after sorting key-useState stick but value changes its position.
** If you don't give key , its takes index as key! Mordern React!

** What's unique? value it's self could be unique.
If key don't exist already durimg re-render then it creates it! if exists then give previous details only!
