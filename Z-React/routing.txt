* content-page get changed but no re-load?
-> cause ever new html link is opened it remove the current html file & bring the new clicked html file from server.
    So, we keep one html file , using Js we manupulate DOM which does not re-load.

* router instalation :- cause we not using vite we use parcel
npm create-vite@latest
npm i react-router
** import { BrowserRouter,Routes,Route,Link } from "react-router";

* we have a liberay in react : router
    router :-  the command i give open that page.
    /  ---> starting default page.
    /contact ----> goes to contact page
    /dashboard ----> goes to dashboard page

** working :-
import { BrowserRouter,Routes,Route } from "react-router"; // import 
//in return 
<BrowserRouter> // it watches ur url change , its a lib component from where routing start 
 <Routes>// you can write many route in routes but only one work which is activated
    // in link you can see that path=""
    <Route path="/" element={<Home></Home>}></Route> // If only "/" in path Goes to home :: default page
    <Route path="/Contact" element={<Contact/>}></Route> // "/Contact" goes to contact 
 </Routes>
</BrowserRouter>
** But in actual website we need button to change content , not going to link and changing path.
    insead of anchor tag we use Link !!!
import { BrowserRouter,Routes,Route,Link } from "react-router";
<BrowserRouter>
<nav> // This will be visible in every page of Route!
    <Link to="/">Home</Link>    // this is converted to anchor tag? cause Link is liberay
    <Link to="/Contact">Contact</Link>
</nav>
</BrowserRouter>

** Nested routing :- /1/2/3 :-Routing.
<Route index element={<Zero/>}></Route> // index means default page when /1 -shows-> /1/Zero works 
<Route path="Hello" element={<Hi/>}></Route> // if u write /Hello it starts to search from root level /Hello don't exist /Details/Hello exist
import { Outlet } from "react-router"; // in /1 file 
// Details return 
return (
    ..
    <Outlet/> // now /1/2 works, that function will render at end cause Outlet at end of return
    // catches that function which user have asked in route
)
* Outlet, helps us to know which  it should show on webpage , It catches the function and show on outlet & runthe function/component , 
    is oulet is written at starting of return all details of that outlet function will be shown at start
    End at End
    Mid at Mid


** useParams :- routing Params :- Dynamic root 
catches info from link in form of object then use that as routing.
    ** import { useParams } from "react-router"
    useParams() is used because React doesn’t automatically know which dynamic values are in your URL.
    BrowserRouter, Routes, Route, Link do read the URL,BUT they do NOT give your component the dynamic value.
    Routing system knows the URL → but your component does not.
    useParams() = gives the URL data to your component.
    * github api : https://api.github.com/users?per_page=20
    ** <Route path="/Github/:name" element={<Github/>}></Route> // that /: will tell that the value is dynamic, name or anything 
    ** where we have kept the info , dynamic catch : 
        const dataByLink = useParams();// catch object 
        dataByLink = {
            name : "Which you have given in url";
        }
        const {name} = useParams(); // exact same key when de-struct object

** object?.key --> if that object exist then go to key and give value.
