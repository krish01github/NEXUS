* create element using react :
    datatype name_ = React.createElement('tagName',{style : attribute},"content");

* dom :
    day1
    // Warning for 18 model of react :: other button won't work untill request is complete.
    ReactDOM.render(ele_which_we_need_to_render,In_which_element_it_should_render);
    ReactDOM.render(ele,document.getElementById('root'));

    day2
    // better : first create root then render it : line 14 
    datatype name_ = ReactDOM.createRoot(root_acting_element);
    const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
    root.render(ele);
    ** Still when u add ele in root then in root first other details will be removed first then add ele in root.
    ** so use [] array in which you mention all yoou need to render at once !


** Js is single therd so when user click something untill it render you can't use any other option.
    but user would click smtg else without waiting for rendering.
    Before React 18 This was a problem. UX problem.
    * ReactRoot container have power to stop rendering if user click smtg else.
        thus it can stop the rendering process and first let event happen!
    SO react is also single threaded But have more power to choose which to execute.


** jsx :- not part of js/react js 
    Write code in normal html that will be converted into react element.
