* create element using react :
    datatype name_ = React.createElement('tagName',{style : attribute},"content");

* dom :
    day1
    // Warning for 18 model of react :: other button won't work untill request is complete.
    ReactDOM.render(ele_which_we_need_to_render,In_which_element_it_should_render);
    ReactDOM.render(ele,document.getElementById('root'));

    day2
    // better : first create root then render it : line 14 
    datatype name_ = ReactDOM.createRoot(root_acting_element);
    const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
    root.render(ele);
    ** Still when u add ele in root then in root first other details will be removed first then add ele in root.
    ** so use [] array in which you mention all yoou need to render at once !


** Js is single therd so when user click something untill it render you can't use any other option.
    but user would click smtg else without waiting for rendering.
    Before React 18 This was a problem. UX problem.
    * ReactRoot container have power to stop rendering if user click smtg else.
        thus it can stop the rendering process and first let event happen!
    SO react is also single threaded But have more power to choose which to execute.


** jsx :- not part of js/react js 
    Write code in normal html that will be converted into react element.

** Not all part of react are gonna be in use so waste space or time on it .
    File size of react should be less and time taken should also be less so we cannot copy the react lib nor use it like link:src in .html .
** Bundler :: so we use Bundler
    Bundler read your files & see your dependency , will optimise your code remove spaces + only select code from react which are being used in code.
    all files html,css,js.
    Many Bundler : webpack,vite,parcel. So, all this optimisation is done by Bundler.

** parcel ::repo  https://github.com/krish01github/NEXUS.git
    npm init
    npm install
    npm install parcel //install parcel , node_module

    node_module , 315mb cause parcel uses other packages and those uses other thus entier node_module comes when u install parcel.
    
    npm install react //react in node module,  no need link in html now
    npm install react-dom

    // package.json -> tells on which my project is depended -> react, parcel, react-dom
    // package-lock.json -> STORES exact version of the packages for your code.
        node_module not adviced to put in git hub.
        package, package-lock + our work share ! if no package-lock then only looks in package then if any update then it does it.

    // version : 0.0.0 ? major.minor.patch -> 
        * ^ symbol means minor & patches npm will  update.
        * ~ patches changes only.
        patch : bug solved , no functionality added 
        minor : new functionality , but older version code still works
        major : older version code get updated such that you can't use in old fasion way.

** npm : link to all devlopment packages.
