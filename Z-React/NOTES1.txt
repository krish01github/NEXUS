React is Js Liberay built on object :-
React,ReactDOM is a object 

React cdn 
<!-- react -->
    <script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react@18/umd/react.development.js"></script>
<!-- reactDom -->
    <script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@18/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>

React Native :- used in mobile development. But in those there is no .html so DOM manupulation is different.
    So, there u don't need reactDom.

** What is cdn ?
Content delivery network.
** Can single server solve all request ? Time of request ?
    They started creating mirror/copy of server Now traffic is reduced. But all server should have same data !!
    so cdn network/ local network introduced :: so now local servers are connected to each other and to main server.
    if nearest server don't have data then request goes to main server , server to server travels to get data.

** content comes first then images ?
    images come from cdn. cdn server hosts the images.when request server we get first html.
    Images take longer to load even from a CDN because, although CDNs host the actual image files and deliver them from
    nearby servers, the browser still needs to first parse the HTML before it knows which images to request. Then it must
    perform network steps like DNS lookup, TCP, and HTTPS handshakes with the CDN, download the full image data (which can be large), and finally decode and render it.
    So even though a CDN speeds up delivery, the image loading still depends on network latency, file size, and browser processing — which is why text (content) appears first and images follow.

    static data : main + other servers. eg: photos/vedio uploaded already.
    dynamic data : kept in main server.eg: likes, subsribe, comments
