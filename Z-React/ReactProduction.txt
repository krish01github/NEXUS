* create element using react :
    datatype name_ = React.createElement('tagName',{style : attribute},"content");

* dom :
    day1
    // Warning for 18 model of react :: other button won't work untill request is complete.
    ReactDOM.render(ele_which_we_need_to_render,In_which_element_it_should_render);
    ReactDOM.render(ele,document.getElementById('root'));

    day2
    // better : first create root then render it : line 14 
    datatype name_ = ReactDOM.createRoot(root_acting_element);
    const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
    root.render(ele);
    ** .render() excepts only one react element. thst one element can have multiple sub-elements.
    ** Still when u add ele in root then in root first other details will be removed first then add ele in root.
    ** so use [] array in which you mention all yoou need to render at once !


** Js is single therd so when user click something untill it render you can't use any other option.
    but user would click smtg else without waiting for rendering.
    Before React 18 This was a problem. UX problem.
    * ReactRoot container have power to stop rendering if user click smtg else.
        thus it can stop the rendering process and first let event happen!
    SO react is also single threaded But have more power to choose which to execute.

** Not all part of react are gonna be in use so waste space or time on it .
    File size of react should be less and time taken should also be less so we cannot copy the react lib nor use it like link:src in .html .
** Bundler :: so we use Bundler
    Bundler read your files & see your dependency , will optimise your code remove spaces + only select code from react which are being used in code.
    all files html,css,js.
    Many Bundler : webpack,vite,parcel. So, all this optimisation is done by Bundler.

** parcel ::repo  https://github.com/krish01github/NEXUS.git
    npm init
    npm install
    npm install parcel //install parcel in node_module

    node_module , 315mb cause parcel uses other packages and those uses other thus entier node_module comes when u install parcel.
    
    npm install react //react in node module,  no need link in html now
    npm install react-dom

    // package.json -> tells on which my project is depended -> react, parcel, react-dom
    // package-lock.json -> STORES exact version of the packages for your code.
        node_module not adviced to put in git hub.
        package, package-lock + our work share ! if no package-lock then only looks in package then if any update then it does it.

    // version : 0.0.0 ? major.minor.patch -> 
        * ^ symbol means minor & patches npm will  update.
        * ~ patches changes only.
        patch : bug solved , no functionality added 
        minor : new functionality , but older version code still works
        major : older version code get updated such that you can't use in old fasion way.

** npm : link to all devlopment packages.

** To use ReactDOM & React without scripttag in .html :- Bundler optimisation 
    in .js :-
        import React  from "react"; // import 
        import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";
    in .html :- Not normal js but module
        < script type = "module" src="" >
    in terminal :- 
        npx parcel htmlFileName.html
    Our production ready code will be in dist folder , cause you can't send every file directly. Bundler will convert it production ready code.
        npx parcel build index.html //root 
        npx parcel build index.html --dist-dir ./dist //current cd
        ** will create dist that has our index.html .js for production
        * .map --> can convert to our previous .js file from dist .js
            so we remove map file from dist for production.

    ** Upload dist for production without .map 
    ** if node -v & parcel not compactabel then segment fault 11 
    ** dist & .parcel-cache & .map files are created ::
