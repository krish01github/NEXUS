Redux Toolkit (Slices) → Creates global state + reducers
configureStore()      → Creates the store
Provider              → Connects store to React
useSelector()         → Read from store
useDispatch()         → Update store

** React Redus :- (store you create, join with the react)
   * context-API : props drilling 
   Redux says no need to do state lifting. I will help you do this by redux.

** Redux toolKit :- Redux Toolkit is used when REACT needs to interact with a GLOBAL STORE
    npm install react-redux
    npm install @reduxjs/toolkit

    // In global store
    import slice1Reducer from "./slice1"; // You can give any name cause default export from slice file 
    import { configureStore } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";
    const store = configureStore({
        reducer : {
            slice1: slice1Reducer // .. such many slices
        }
    })
   * Global_STORE a centralised data , create it which is available for all.
     keep all data , functions.

   *Reducer
     change of those data should also done globally. So all other componets could get the updated value.
     those function which makes changes in global data is called reducer.

   ***Dispatch : useDispatch its a hook 
   import { useDispatch } from "react-redux";
   import  {Increment,Deccrement,Reset } from "../features/slice1"; // Import functions of splice
   * Takes the function call from other file.jsx to Global_STORE.
     ** this is a action 
     dispatch(function_name()); // takes to global_store where reducer/function body are kept.
     * in reducer chceks that function and runs.
   *  dispatch(slice1.Increment()) , 
      **console.log(Increment())->action : {type : "slice1/Increment", payload:undefined}
      //payload is nothing but action  part, helps in passing argument to reducer -> action.payload -> argument
      dispatch(Increment()) will return {type : slice1/Increment}, cause only slice1 should have that function else error!
      
      ** reducer : {functionName : (state, action)=>{state.count = action.payload}}
      * 2 slice function name could be same , 
        thus use * dispatch(slice1.Increment()) or * import function_name as new_function_name so avoid using same function_name.
        import * as slice1 from "../slice1"; ||dispatch(slice1.increment());
        import * as slice2 from "../slice2"; ||dispatch(slice2.increment());
      How does it knows that function is of splice1 cause it send request to all splices finds where taht function exist then run it!


   ***Slice : 
   import { createSlice } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";
   const Var_name = createSlice({}); // object-store all data/function in key-value
   *  when you keep same name of data/function in global_store ? then which reducer/function or data to use and run CONFUSION.
      DIVIDE Your global_store into slice :-
        slice1 : all data & reducers/functions
        slice2 : all data & reducers/functions
    * So, now when you dispatch , slice will decide where to go and which reducer to use.
        Slice should have unique name !!
        * how to know if slice name is already used?
        -configureStore : all slice names !
    * after creating slice export it to global store.
      Import all slice in global_store & configureStore with slice name : reducer name
    
    // To use those slice function/reducers 
    ** export const {Increment,Deccrement,Reset } = reactSlicer.actions; // slice file 
       import  {Increment,Deccrement,Reset } from "../features/slice1"; // import in components
       so that we can use those function in components.

**  export const {Increment,Deccrement,Reset } = reactSlicer.actions; // count.jsx , where function are used , dispatch power!
**  export default reactSlicer.reducer; // reducer ! Global store! 

//app.jsx main React file to store 
** import { Provider } from "react-redux";
   import stores from "./features/store"; 
   return(<Provider store={stores}>
   
   </Provider>)
   In main app.jsx  + store // so that store can be available for all childs/decendents.

** In store we add slice by matching slice & reducer .

** import { useSelector } from "react-redux"; // when u use useSelector it bring the global_state everthing is mention in that.
    * Only helps to read data!
        globalstate → the entire Redux global state create in background. key(sliceName) - value(MostUpdatedValue)
        globalstate.someSlice → the slice key inside the store
        globalstate.someSlice.someValue → the specific data inside that slice
    const var = useSelector((globalstate)=>globalstate.slice1.count);
    const globalstate = { // when use useSelector : global_state
        slice1:{
            count:0,  // initialState value 
            .. multiple value
        },
        ..Multiple slice 
    }
    * global_state React-Redux automatically gives it to all components through the Provider.
   to access other infomation other than reducer in slice we use useSelector 

* how will i get the latest value cause initialState will give 0 in slice ?
we use callback just like useState function that uses callback to get previous value and update it then return it.
// const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
// setCount((preVal)=>preVal+1);
