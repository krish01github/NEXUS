IP Address
IP (Internet Protocol) Address**: A unique number that identifies a device on the internet.  

- Dynamic IP: Each time you connect to the internet, your ISP (e.g., Jio, Airtel) assigns you an IP.  
  When you disconnect, it can be reassigned.

## Types of IP

- Public IP: Unique globally; assigned to your router by ISP.   
- Private IP: Used inside local networks, unique within that network.  

  - Large corporations → `10.0.0.0 – 10.255.255.255`  
  - Medium networks → `172.16.0.0 – 172.31.255.255`  
  - Home/common use → `192.168.0.0 – 192.168.255.255`  

* Within local server : we can transfer data with only MAC address.
## IPv4 vs IPv6

- IPv4: 32-bit, written as `x.x.x.x` (0–255 per block).  
  Total ~4.3 billion addresses.  
- IPv6: 128-bit, supports virtually unlimited devices (`2^128`).

# DNS (Domain Name System)

DNS converts **domain names** into **IP addresses**.  

1. Browser Cache Check → Browser checks if IP is already stored locally.  
2. Recursive DNS Server → Provided by ISP or public DNS (Google DNS, Cloudflare). Stores recently requested IPs in cache.  
3. Root Server → 13 main clusters worldwide. Points to the correct **TLD server** (e.g., `.com`, `.org`).  
4. TLD Server → Directs the query to the domain’s **Authoritative Server**.  
5. Authoritative Server → Contains the actual IP of the domain. Sends it back.  
6. Return to Browser → Browser gets the IP and connects to the website’s server.

# Server Slow Case

- Your IP (from ISP/router) is **unique while you’re online**.  
- If you disconnect, the IP may later be assigned to another user.  
- If the server is slow and still processing your request, it continues using your **original IP + MAC address**.  
- Your request never “goes to another computer,” even if the same IP is later reassigned.

# MAC Address

- **MAC (Media Access Control) Address**: Hardware/physical address of your device; unique globally.  
- Each network interface (Wi-Fi, Ethernet, Bluetooth) has its own MAC.  
- Ensures your request is uniquely tied to your device.  
- Example: **Airdrop** works using MAC addresses.  
- Format: 48-bit, hexadecimal (e.g., `00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E`).  

**Check:**  
- macOS/Linux → `ifconfig`  
- Windows → `ipconfig /all`

# Ports

- **Port Number**: Tells the system which application should receive the data.  
- Useful when multiple apps/tabs are open → ensures the right app gets the right response.  
- Format: 16-bit (`0–65535`).  

Port Ranges
- Well-known (0–1023):
  - FTP → 21  
  - SSH → 22  
  - DNS → 53  
  - HTTP → 80  
  - HTTPS → 443  
- Registered (1024–49151): Used by software vendors (not public).  
- Dynamic/Private (49152–65535): Commonly used for temporary connections.

# HTTP vs HTTPS

- HTTP → Not secure, data is plain text.  
- HTTPS → Secure, data is encrypted (SSL/TLS).  

VPN :
Your ISP and others on the network cannot see which sites you visit — they only see that you are connected to the VPN.
The VPN server assigns you a new IP address, hiding your real IP from websites.

Q. WEB DEVLOPMENT ?
-> client request server for site so server return html,css,js files to client.
